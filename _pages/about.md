I'm passionate about AI, Open-Source Software, ~~Crypto~~, Yoga and Basketball.  

`AI Solutions Specialist` I excel at solving novel problems with AI. I'm a PhD student of Artificial Intelligence in the School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology at the University of Bristol supervised by [Dr. Ryan McConville](https://ryanmcconville.com). If you have any questions that I can help with, please feel free to reach out via email at `will dot leeney at outlook dot com` or on LinkedIn.

`Supervision` Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in mentorship, guiding over 50 machine learning projects for final year undergraduates. I excel in helping students formulate research problems, design experiments, and effectively communicate their findings through written reports and presentations.

`Thesis` <b>Unsupervised Graph Neural Networks: Training Strategies and Evaluation Principles.</b> 
- I demonstrated the need of a framework for more reliable evaluations showing the importance of experimental conditions. 
- I proposed empirically quantifying the sensitivity of performance
comparisons to randomness.
- I showed that it is possible to train GNNs with modularity to bypass a supervised optimisation in model selection
or hyperparameter tuning.
- I extended the framework to a new scenario for community detection, showing that multiple clients can collaborate on learning. 


Areas of Study
---
- `Unsupervised Learning`
- `GNNs`
- `Randomness in ML Benchmarking`
- `Federated Learning`
- `Community Detection`

I'm interested in AI as I believe we can improve the lives of all humans through practical machine learning. It's also pretty fun seeing sci-fi dreams come to life. The applications of my research can be to improve latent representations for enhancing search; to encode patient information for health care to predict drug treatment recommendation; to help detect fake news on social media networks; to find financial indicator signals for price prediction trading algorithms.
