I'm a PhD student of Artificial Intelligence in the School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology at the University of Bristol supervised by [Dr. Ryan McConville](https://ryanmcconville.com). I study `Unsupervised Learning`, `Randomness in Benchmarking`, `GNNs`, `Federated Learning`, `Community Detection`. I'm passionate about open-source software, ~~Crypto~~, Yoga and Basketball. 

If you have any questions that I can help with, please feel free to reach out via email at will.leeney@bristol.ac.uk or on LinkedIn.
