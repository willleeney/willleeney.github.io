I'm passionate about AI, Open-Source Software, ~~Crypto~~, Crypto, Yoga and Basketball.  

`AI Generalist` I completed my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bristol supervised by [Dr. Ryan McConville](https://ryanmcconville.com). My thesis examined current evaluation practice for machine learning, exploring how evaluations can misrepresent algorithms performance. I have spent years rigorously (I know LLMs love this word, but it is the most appropriate) comparing models against one another, so I know the importance of proper benchmarking practice (and subsequently I know how to get the best out of each model). These learnings apply in all machine learning problems because without a consistent evaluation you cannot know which algorithm you should employ.

`Supervision` Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in mentorship, guiding over 50 machine learning projects for final year undergraduates. I helped students formulate research problems, design experiments, and effectively communicate their findings through written reports and presentations.


`Thesis` <b>Unsupervised Graph Neural Networks: Training Strategies and Evaluation Principles.</b> This will be made available for public consumption shortly. 
- I demonstrated the need of a framework for more reliable evaluations showing the importance of experimental conditions. 
- I proposed empirically quantifying the sensitivity of performance
comparisons to randomness.
- I showed that it is possible to train GNNs with modularity to bypass a supervised optimisation in model selection
or hyperparameter tuning.
- I extended the framework to a new scenario for community detection, showing that multiple clients can collaborate on learning.

I'm interested in AI as I believe we can improve the lives of all humans through practical machine learning. It's also pretty fun seeing sci-fi dreams come to life. The applications of my research can be to improve latent representations for enhancing search; to encode patient information for health care to predict drug treatment recommendation; to help detect fake news on social media networks; to find financial indicator signals for price prediction trading algorithms.
