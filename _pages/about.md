I'm a PhD student of Artificial Intelligence in the School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology at the University of Bristol supervised by [Dr. Ryan McConville](https://ryanmcconville.com). I'm passionate about Open-Source Software, ~~Crypto~~, Yoga and Basketball.  If you have any questions that I can help with, please feel free to reach out via email at will.leeney@bristol.ac.uk or on LinkedIn. <a href="/files/leeney_will.pdf" download="leeney_will.pdf">Click here download CV.</a>

Areas of Study
---
- `Unsupervised Learning`
- `GNNs`
- `Randomness in ML Benchmarking`
- `Federated Learning`
- `Community Detection`

I'm interested in AI as I believe we can improve the lives of all humans through practical machine learning. It's also pretty fun seeing sci-fi dreams come to life. The applications of my research can be to improve latent representations for enhancing search; to encode patient information for health care to predict drug treatment recommendation; to help detect fake news on social media networks; to find financial indicator signals for price prediction trading algorithms.
