title: "A Framework for Exploring Federated Community Detection"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/legion_1
excerpt: 'Federated Learning is machine learning in the context of a network of clients whilst maintaining data residency and/or privacy constraints. Community detection is the unsupervised discovery of clusters of nodes within graph-structured data. The intersection of these two fields uncovers much opportunity, but also challenge. For example, it adds complexity due to missing connectivity information between privately held graphs. In this work, we explore the potential of federated community detection by conducting initial experiments across a range of existing datasets that showcase the gap in performance introduced by the distributed data. We demonstrate that isolated models would benefit from collaboration establishing a framework for investigating challenges within this domain. The intricacies of these research frontiers are discussed alongside proposed solutions to these issues.'
