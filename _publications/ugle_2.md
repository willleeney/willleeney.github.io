collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ugle_2
excerpt: '(1) The enhanced capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in unsupervised community detection of clustered nodes is attributed to their capacity to encode both the connectivity and feature information spaces of graphs. The identification of latent communities holds practical significance in various domains, from social networks to genomics. Current real-world performance benchmarks are perplexing due to the multitude of decisions influencing GNN evaluations for this task. (2) Three metrics are compared to assess the consistency of algorithm rankings in the presence of randomness. The consistency and quality of performance between the results under a hyperparameter optimisation with the default hyperparameters is evaluated. (3) The results compare hyperparameter optimisation with default hyperparameters, revealing a significant performance loss when neglecting hyperparameter investigation. A comparison of metrics indicates that ties in ranks can substantially alter the quantification of randomness. (4) Ensuring adherence to the same evaluation criteria may result in notable differences in the reported performance of methods for this task. The W Randomness coefficient, based on the Wasserstein distance, is identified as providing the most robust assessment of randomness.'
