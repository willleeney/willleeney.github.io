This talk was selected for Oral Presentation as part of a contribution to Complex Networks 2023. I talked about the need for consistent benchmarking practices in GNN community detection, demonstrated the drop in performance due to not carrying out a hyperparameter optimisation. I proposed a metric for quantifying randomness of the rankings of between different algorithms. The slides are available <a href="https://github.com/willleeney/willleeney.github.io/blob/master/files/346_Leeney.pdf">here</a>.
