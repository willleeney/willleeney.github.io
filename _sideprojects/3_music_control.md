title: "3 Holistic Spotify Control"
excerpt: "I wanted to play music in my room using the posters of album art. My project uses a camera to detect when I ‘click’ on the album art on my wall using my hand to play the corresponding music on my speakers. This is an ongoing project; the next step is to put the software on a standalone device.
- Uses 3D CNNs to detect hand landmark positions on video footage
- Recognises simple gestures to control user interface.
- Object detection and google vision API to detect album art
on wall and search for associated album.
- Spotify API to play music on speakers."
