title: "2 WRandAi"
excerpt: "Today I made my first PyPi package. This is for calculating the W Randomness Coefficient of a set of algorithms on a suite of Machine Learning benchmarks. This quantifies the uncertainty of different algorithms' ranking due to the presence of testing on different random seeds. Just use `pip install wrandai`."
