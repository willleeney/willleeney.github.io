title: "2 Poem Generator"
excerpt: "This project uses the openai api's to recognise voice input and convert the audio to text; generate a poem from the trigger words then play the poem in a generated voice. As this uses the research purpose only apis it won't be released to the public. Nethertheless, this is still pretty cool that it's really easy to build something like this or I'm one of these 10x coders you hear so much about. Either way, this demonstrates the promise of AI technology in case you hadn't heard about this little thing called machine learning. <br/><img src='/images/poem_generator.png'>"
