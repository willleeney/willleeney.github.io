In this unit, students work on particular mathematical/computational methodologies through grounding in team-based problem-solving applied to real world problems from external stakeholders. Supervision is provided in the form of model feedback, providing guidance to suitable solutions, helping team management and facilitating communication. The deliverable is a substantial technical report for the first two phases and a presentation for the last phase which is proposing and completing a technical startup.
