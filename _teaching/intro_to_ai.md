In the first half of the year, students are introduced to classic artificial intelligence methods followed by an understanding in basic and complex neural network practices. In the later half, students ground this understanding by proposing and completing a machine learning project, where they produce code and an accompanying paper.

Example Projects:
- Pose tracking tools to develop dance rating score of video footage compared with professional dances
- Automated Weight lifting competition judge
- Crypto currency social media analysis
- Veganise any recipe
- Integration teacher
- Emotion identification from face cam 
- RL environment generalisation comparison
- Album art genre classification 
- CNNs to analyse plant health
- Combining decision trees with unsupervised clustering for recommending tv shows/films
